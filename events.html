        <div ><h2>Quantathon, sponsored by Goldman Sachs</h2></div>
        <div>
          <p><i>Quantathon</i> brings together students from a variety of backgrounds to tackle interesting and challenging problems in computational finance. Quantathon is usually held during the spring semester.</p>
          <p>One of the founders of Quant Club, Sijie Wei, said:</p>
          <p>
            We love working around great minds to solve great problems... This
            competition is a great opportunity for students to apply their quantitative skills such as mathematics, probability, statistical analysis and so on in the field of finance.
          </p>
          <p>One sophomore math major who won the first place in Quantathon 2019, Gunmay Handa, said:</p>
          <p>
            There’s a sense of satisfaction that comes from putting ideas together from different areas of math and pushing harder and harder until you finally solve it...

        <div><h2>Market Making Game, sponsored by Optiver</h2></div>
        <div >
        <p>The Market Making Game is a thought-provoking event combining estimation, negotiation and optimization. It is usually held during both semesters.
        </p> <p>
          Twenty-five teams started the game with contracts and some (fake) cash. Throughout five rounds of play, teams had to use their cash to buy contracts or sell contracts to make more cash. However, there was a catch. They didn’t actually know the value of the contracts. Instead, each round rotated through questions about the economy, mathematical puzzles and general trivia that teams had to solve to reveal the price of the contracts.
          </p> <p>
          A senior computational finance major, Dallas Foster, said:
          </p><p>
          The most challenging part is the uncertainty that comes from not knowing the exact value of the contract and having to trade it anyways if you want any chance to make money. It wasn’t about whether the traders knew they were 100% right but whether they had a good feeling that they were more right than others. That line of thought applied to the game as well. </p>

                Alumni that are currently working in the quantitative finance industry will conduct one-on-one mock interviews with selected candidates. According to historical feedback, this is one of the best ways for students to prepare for the recruiting process and get to know about the industry. There may also be a networking event at the end of the mock interviews where you can get to interact with the interviewers.

                Dexter Senft is a mathematician and computer scientist who 
                wandered onto Wall Street in the early 1970s. Back then, 
                transactions took a week or more to process and securities 
                exchanged hands physically, in paper form. PCs would not exist for 
                another decade. Dexter achieved fame by publishing a mathematical 
                explanation of mortgage securities and how to predict their cash 
                flows. He rose to the ranks of senior management at First Boston, 
                Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley. He played an important role 
                in developing the use of computers on Wall Street. He was inducted 
                into the Fixed Income Analyst Society Hall of Fame in 2004.

                You've probably heard of Moore's Law and how computers get 
                exponentially better over time. But have you thought about it in 
                reverse? This talk will illustrate what the early practitioners 
                of quantitative finance had to work with, and how fixed income 
                markets evolved almost in lock-step with practitioners' ability 
                to calculate the values of portfolios and the investment and 
                risk management strategies they could engage in.
